My approach to the rocket midterm:

Art:
I drew spritesheets for the asteroid and rocket using a pixel art program, Aseprite. I used the same program to draw a static image for the parallax background.



Scene:

I initialized it in the Scene's initGL() with the file path "images/




Inputs:





Parallax:







Player:




Enemy:
